# HTTP Benchmark Project

## Overview
The HTTP Benchmark project is a Go application designed to benchmark HTTP servers. It provides tools for creating jobs, managing workers, and running benchmarks to measure server performance.

## Project Structure
```

├── go.mod                # Go module file
├── benchmark/
│   ├── benchmark.go      # Benchmark logic
│   ├── job.go            # Job creation and management
│   └── worker.go         # Worker logic for executing jobs
├── cmd/

├── flags/
│   └── flags.go          # Command-line flag parsing
├── http-client/
    └── http-client.go    # HTTP client for making requests
```

## Features
- **Benchmarking**: Measure the performance of HTTP servers.
- **Job Management**: Create and manage benchmarking jobs.
- **Worker System**: Distribute benchmarking tasks across workers.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Use flags to configure benchmarking parameters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.20 or later
